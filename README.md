### Kaggle 'SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection'

In this competition, you’ll identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, you'll categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia(폐렴이 아닌지) or typical(정형성 폐렴인지), indeterminate(불확실), or atypical(비정형 폐렴) for COVID-19. You and your model will work with imaging data and annotations from a group of radiologists.
